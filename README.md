# Regi

[![Build](https://github.com/mcuelenaere/regi/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mcuelenaere/regi/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A native macOS client for [JetKVM](https://jetkvm.com) and [PiKVM](https://pikvm.org) hardware.

## What it is

JetKVM and PiKVM both ship web-based control panels that run in a
browser tab and work fine for casual remote-control. But a browser
can't capture macOS system shortcuts — ⌘Tab, ⌘Space, ⌘Q — so they get
eaten by your Mac instead of reaching the host. Regi is a native macOS
app that fixes this and a handful of other rough edges along the way.

It talks each device's native protocol — JetKVM's WebRTC + JSON-RPC +
HID-RPC, or PiKVM's Janus WebRTC video + `/api/ws` input — behind one
unified UI; the difference is in the macOS integration around it.

## Features

- **JetKVM and PiKVM in one app.** Core remote control — video, keyboard,
  mouse, and scroll — works on either family. JetKVM additionally exposes
  ATX power, codec/quality, and clipboard sync; those device-specific
  controls are hidden when they don't apply (PiKVM parity is on the
  roadmap).
- **Real keyboard capture.** System shortcuts — ⌘Tab, ⌘Space (Spotlight),
  ⌘Q, ⌘H, Mission Control, function keys — route to the remote host via
  `CGEventTap`. Engages automatically when the session window is
  frontmost; suspends the moment you switch apps so your Mac isn't
  fighting you.
- **mDNS / Bonjour discovery.** JetKVM (`_jetkvm._tcp`) and PiKVM
  (`_pikvm._tcp`) devices on your LAN appear in the host list
  automatically — no URL typing, no scanning.
- **Multi-window, multi-device.** Connect to several devices at once,
  each in its own window with its own video stream, signaling channel,
  and session state.
- **Pointer lock for FPS / CAD work.** Optional mode that pins the
  cursor and delivers raw relative motion, so the host cursor doesn't
  walk away from yours on multi-monitor host setups.
- **In-app TLS trust prompt.** JetKVM and PiKVM both ship self-signed
  certs by default. Regi surfaces a one-time "Trust certificate" prompt
  with the actual failure reason instead of a generic browser warning,
  and remembers your choice per host.
- **Keychain-backed passwords.** Per-host, scoped to the app.
- **Bandwidth gate** *(JetKVM)*. When the session window is minimised or
  fully covered, Regi tells the device to pause its encoder (after a 5 s
  debounce). Saves device CPU and LAN bandwidth while the window's
  hidden; resumes instantly when you bring it back.
- **First-class native UI.** SwiftUI, Mission Control thumbnails,
  Window menu entries with each host's display name, native
  fullscreen, real app icon in the Dock.


## Differences vs. the JetKVM web frontend

| | JetKVM web UI | Regi |
|---|---|---|
| System shortcuts (⌘Tab, ⌘Q, ⌘Space, …) | macOS swallows them | Forwarded to the host |
| Find devices on the LAN | Type the URL | Auto-discovery via mDNS |
| Multiple devices | One browser tab each | Multiple native windows |
| Self-signed cert | Browser security warning | In-app trust prompt |
| Window minimised / occluded | Keeps streaming | Pauses encoder (5 s debounce) |
| Passwords | Browser autofill (if remembered) | macOS Keychain |
| Pointer lock | HTML5 Pointer Lock API | Native CG APIs |
| Updates | Browser cache | Standalone `.app` |

The same comparison holds for PiKVM's web UI — a browser can't forward
macOS shortcuts there either.

What Regi *doesn't* replace: anything that's not part of an active
remote-control session. The device's setup flow, advanced settings,
firmware updates, and (for PiKVM) ATX power and mass-storage controls
are still done through the web UI. Regi assumes you've configured the
device there at least once.

## Controlling Regi with an LLM (MCP)

Regi embeds an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server, so an LLM
agent can drive a remote machine through it — take a screenshot, move
the mouse, type, press shortcuts, and connect to hosts. The server runs
*inside the app*: it starts automatically on launch and listens on
`localhost:8765`. The hosts list shows its status (`MCP :8765 · N
clients`) with a button to stop or restart it.

Because the server lives in the app, **Regi must be running** before a
client can connect. Connect [Claude
Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) with:

```sh
claude mcp add --transport sse regi http://localhost:8765/sse
```

Then `claude mcp list` should report `regi` as connected. The server is
bound to loopback only (not reachable from other machines) and exposes
these tools:

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `list_hosts` | List saved and mDNS-discovered KVM hosts |
| `connect` / `disconnect` | Open or close a session (by saved-host name or raw address) |
| `get_status` | Session state, video size, latency, FPS, codec |
| `screenshot` | Capture the remote screen as a JPEG |
| `mouse_move` / `mouse_click` / `mouse_scroll` | Pointer control (coords are 0.0–1.0 fractions) |
| `key` | Press a key or combo (`ctrl+c`, `cmd+space`, `enter`, …) |
| `type` | Type a string of text |

## Requirements

- macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later
- A JetKVM or PiKVM device reachable on the network
- **JetKVM**: for HTTPS to default-config devices, firmware that
  produces RFC 5280-compliant certificate serial numbers (recent
  firmware does; older firmware still works over plain HTTP, and the
  in-app trust prompt handles the self-signed CA either way)
- **PiKVM**: H.264 / WebRTC streaming via `kvmd-janus` enabled (the
  default on current PiKVM OS images); the in-app trust prompt handles
  its self-signed certificate. mDNS auto-discovery needs `avahi-daemon`
  running on the device — otherwise add it by host/IP manually.

## Installation

Grab `Regi.dmg` from the [latest release](https://github.com/mcuelenaere/regi/releases/latest) and drag `Regi.app` into `/Applications`. A bare `Regi.zip` is on the same release page if you'd rather skip the disk image.

> [!NOTE]
> Regi isn't currently signed by an Apple-trusted developer ID, so macOS Gatekeeper refuses the first launch with *"can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software."* Bypass once and macOS remembers your choice:
>
> - **Finder**: right-click `Regi.app` → **Open** → confirm in the dialog. Subsequent double-clicks work normally.
> - **Terminal**: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Regi.app`

### Building from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mcuelenaere/regi.git
cd regi
open Regi.xcodeproj
```

Hit ⌘R in Xcode.

## About the name

Regi is Esperanto for *to rule*, *to govern*, *to take control* —
which is, roughly, what a KVM client does. You point it at a remote
machine and you're in charge: keyboard, mouse, screen. The name is
short, pronounceable in most languages (*REH-ghee*), and has no prior
tech-product baggage.
